# Design document and dataset description.

For this final task I choose sentiment analysis task for movie 

I will use dataset for this task.

## Model
* As I'm using quite simple model (stacked LSTM) and I have quite easy classification task(binary classification), I trained from scratch, using ML flow
* I'm using binary-cross entropy for this task
* I trained embedings from scratch for this task

## Structure and client 
* I decided to use asynchronous project with Selery and Flask
* I decided to create simple HTML Frontend page for movie review
